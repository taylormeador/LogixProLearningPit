# LogixProLearningPit
This repo is meant to document my progress as I work through the ladder logic exercises from thelearningpit.com

You can find more info about these exercises by visiting http://thelearningpit.com/lp/doc/index.html and scrolling down to the section titled "Student RSLogix Programming Exercises"

While I understand that LogixPro is not an entirely realistic simulation environment, it is the best tool I currently have to continue working on my PLC skills.

If you do not have LogixPro you can still see images of the ladder logic I wrote and a screenshot of the simulation environment that will show you the location and addresses of the inputs and outputs
